    """Different control modes for the cluster

    Each enumaration is contains three objects: 
    (1) Name: str
    (2) Bearing Offset: float [rad]
    (3) Cross-Track Error Gain: float [bearing/ difference in z units]

    For example, for the MAX mode, we have the entry:

        MAX = ("maximum", 0.0, 0.0)

        "maximum" is the name.

        0.0 is the bearing offset. In this case, there is a 0.0 offset 
        with the current gradient vector that is calculated.

        0.0 is the cross-track error gain. In this case, there is a 0.0
        cross-track error gain because this mode does not include any
        contour tracing.
    
    For example, for the CROSSTRACK_CCW mode, we have the entry:

        CROSSTRACK_CCW = ("crosstrack_ccw_controller", math.pi/2, 1.0)

        "crosstrack_ccw_controller" is the name.

        math.pi/2 is the bearing offset. In this case, there is a 90 deg. offset 
        with the current gradient vector that is calculated. This makes sense as
        this makes the cluster travel along the contour level curve instead of
        towards the peak/valley that the gradient is currently aiming towards.

        1.0 is the cross-track error gain. In this case, there is a 1.0
        cross-track error gain so that a difference in 10 z-units 
        (e.g. RSSI strength) corresponds to a angle adjustment of 10 radians.
